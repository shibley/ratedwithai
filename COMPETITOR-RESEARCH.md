## Market Landscape

The web accessibility tools market is growing rapidly, driven by:
- Increasing ADA lawsuits (4,000+ federal lawsuits/year)
- European Accessibility Act (EAA) enforcement starting 2025
- WCAG 2.2 adoption
- Market size estimated at $51B+ (accessiBe's claimed TAM)

## Key Competitors

### Tier 1: Enterprise / Overlay Solutions

#### accessiBe
- **URL:** accessibe.com
- **What:** AI-powered accessibility overlay + automated compliance
- **Pricing:** From $490/year (small sites) to custom enterprise
- **Revenue:** ~$51M+ (Series A funded)
- **Strengths:** 100K+ websites, strong brand, 48-hour compliance claim, easy install (one line of JS)
- **Weaknesses:** VERY controversial — overlay approach criticized by disability community, multiple lawsuits, NFB (National Federation of the Blind) opposes it. Not real compliance.
- **Content/SEO:** Active blog, publishes competitor comparisons, has SEO presence
- **Our angle:** We're transparent about what automated scanning can/can't catch. No overlay snake oil.

#### UserWay
- **URL:** userway.org
- **What:** AI-powered accessibility widget + manual auditing
- **Pricing:** Free widget, paid plans from $49/mo
- **Strengths:** Free tier drives adoption, 1M+ installations
- **Weaknesses:** Similar overlay criticism as accessiBe, though less intense
- **Our angle:** We show real scores and real issues, not a cosmetic widget

#### AudioEye
- **URL:** audioeye.com
- **What:** Automated + manual hybrid accessibility platform
- **Pricing:** From $49/mo (small sites) to enterprise
- **Revenue:** Public company, ~$32M revenue
- **Strengths:** Hybrid approach (automation + human testing), legal protection guarantee
- **Weaknesses:** Expensive for SMBs, also uses overlay approach
- **Our angle:** 10x cheaper for basic scanning, no overlay lock-in

#### EqualWeb
- **URL:** equalweb.com
- **What:** AI accessibility widget
- **Pricing:** From $490/year
- **Strengths:** Multilingual, broad compliance coverage
- **Weaknesses:** Smaller market share, overlay criticism applies

### Tier 2: Developer Tools (Free/Freemium)

#### WAVE (WebAIM)
- **URL:** wave.webaim.org
- **What:** Free web accessibility evaluation tool
- **Pricing:** Free browser extension, API from $100/month
- **Strengths:** Trusted by developers, free, educational, well-known brand
- **Weaknesses:** Technical UI, no monitoring/SaaS features, one-page-at-a-time
- **Our angle:** We're accessible (no pun intended) to non-developers. Business owners can understand our reports.

#### axe (Deque)
- **URL:** deque.com/axe
- **What:** Open-source accessibility testing engine (we use axe-core!)
- **Pricing:** Free extension, axe Monitor from $6K+/year
- **Strengths:** Industry standard engine, trusted, open-source
- **Weaknesses:** Enterprise pricing puts it out of SMB reach
- **Our angle:** We use axe-core under the hood but package it for non-technical users at $29/mo

#### Lighthouse (Google)
- **URL:** Built into Chrome DevTools
- **What:** Web performance + accessibility auditing
- **Pricing:** Free
- **Strengths:** Built into Chrome, widely used, free
- **Weaknesses:** Limited accessibility checks, developer-focused, no monitoring
- **Our angle:** We go deeper on accessibility than Lighthouse, plus monitoring

### Tier 3: Monitoring / Enterprise

#### Siteimprove
- **Pricing:** Custom (typically $10K+/year)
- **What:** Enterprise web governance including accessibility
- **Our angle:** We're the SMB alternative

#### Level Access (Tenon)

### Content gaps competitors DON'T fill:
- Industry-specific compliance guides (restaurants, healthcare, etc.)
- "Is [brand] accessible?" programmatic pages
- CMS-specific accessibility guides (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
- State-level lawsuit statistics
- Affordable monitoring for SMBs

## Research Notes:
- accessiBe is controversial — Reddit/HN communities actively dislike overlays
- This is an OPPORTUNITY: position as the "honest" alternative
- The disability community wants real fixes, not cosmetic overlays
- EAA (European Accessibility Act) is creating new urgency in 2025-2026
- Most SMBs have no idea they're at legal risk — education content converts well
