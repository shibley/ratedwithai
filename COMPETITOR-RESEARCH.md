## Executive Summary

The web accessibility overlay market is under increasing legal and regulatory scrutiny. In January 2025, the FTC fined accessiBe $1 million for deceptive marketing claims. According to UsableNet's 2024 report, **25% of all digital accessibility lawsuits (1,023 cases) explicitly cited overlay widgets as barriers rather than solutions**. This creates a massive opportunity for RatedWithAI to position as the honest, transparent alternative.

---

## Market Landscape

The web accessibility tools market is growing rapidly, driven by:
- Increasing ADA lawsuits (4,000+ federal lawsuits/year)
- European Accessibility Act (EAA) enforcement starting 2025
- WCAG 2.2 adoption
- Market size estimated at $51B+ (accessiBe's claimed TAM)

### Critical Industry Development: Overlay Backlash
- **800+ businesses** using overlay solutions faced accessibility lawsuits in 2023-2024
- Courts consistently **reject overlay installation as evidence of good-faith compliance**
- **National Federation of the Blind (NFB)** formally opposes all overlay approaches
- **600+ accessibility professionals** signed a statement declaring overlays do not meet legal requirements

### Target Market
- Small to mid-size businesses seeking "quick fix" compliance
- Non-technical business owners afraid of ADA lawsuits
- Marketing-driven decision makers
- Companies that want to check a compliance box without deep remediation

### Strengths
- ✅ Easy installation (single JavaScript snippet)
- ✅ Strong marketing and brand awareness (100K+ websites)
- ✅ 24-hour automated scanning
- ✅ Multiple pricing tiers for different business sizes
- ✅ Litigation support and legal pledges (marketing appeal)
- ✅ 33 language support

### Weaknesses
- ❌ **FTC $1 Million Fine (January 2025)**: Fined for false advertising claims that AI could make websites fully WCAG compliant
- ❌ **Class Action Lawsuit (June 2024)**: Tribeca Skin Care filed class action alleging widgets failed to provide ADA compliance
- ❌ **National Federation of the Blind Opposition**: NFB formally criticized accessiBe and called for businesses to remove overlays
- ❌ **Court Rulings Against Overlays**: Multiple courts ruled overlays don't fix underlying code issues
- ❌ **Target for Lawsuits**: Plaintiff attorneys specifically target accessiBe users via tools like BuiltWith
- ❌ **Interferes with Assistive Technology**: Overlays can conflict with users' existing screen readers
- ❌ **False Sense of Security**: Only detects ~30-40% of WCAG issues; leaves 60-70% unaddressed
- ❌ **No Source Code Fixes**: Modifications disappear if overlay fails to load
- ❌ **Controversial Reviews**: Capterra reviews cite lack of pricing transparency and difficult cancellation

### How RatedWithAI Differentiates
1. **Transparency over promises**: We show real scan results, not a cosmetic layer
2. **No overlay snake oil**: We identify issues and tell you how to fix them—no false compliance claims
3. **Lower price point**: $29/mo vs $490+/year starting
4. **No litigation risk**: Our customers aren't lawsuit targets because we don't claim to "fix" accessibility
5. **FTC-proof marketing**: We're honest about what automated scanning can and can't do
