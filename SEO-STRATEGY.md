## 🔗 Internal Linking Strategy

```
Homepage ← → All page types (hub and spoke)

Brand check pages → Related industry page
                  → WCAG criteria they violate
                  → "Fix this" → CMS guide
                  → Comparison (vs competitor tools)

WCAG pages → Related WCAG criteria
           → Brand pages that violate this
           → CMS guide for fixing

Industry pages → Brand checks in that industry
              → State pages (lawsuit risk)
              → Blog content

CMS pages → WCAG criteria to check
          → Industry pages using this CMS
          → Blog tutorials

State pages → Industry pages
           → Blog (lawsuit stats)

Blog → Everything (hub content)
```

## 📈 Traffic Projections

| Month | Indexed Pages | Organic Traffic/mo | Free Scans/mo | Paid Conversions |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 50 | 200 | 500 | 5 |
| 2 | 350 | 2,000 | 2,000 | 20 |
| 3 | 430 | 5,000 | 5,000 | 50 |
| 6 | 500+ | 15,000 | 10,000 | 100 |
| 12 | 700+ | 40,000 | 25,000 | 250-500 |

Assumptions: 2% of organic visitors try free scan, 1% of free scans convert to paid

## 🏆 Competitive Advantages

1. **pSEO at scale** — competitors don't do this. accessiBe has a blog, not 500+ programmatic pages
2. **Free scanner as lead magnet** — captures intent at the top of funnel
3. **Price point** — $29/mo vs accessiBe's $490/yr. Massive gap for SMBs
4. **Transparency** — show exactly what's wrong, not just an overlay. accessiBe is controversial for "fake" fixes
5. **Cross-link network** — 5 sites boosting each other's DA
6. **Speed to market** — can launch 350+ pages in 2 weeks with our pSEO playbook

## 🚫 What NOT to Target

- Enterprise keywords (Deque, Level Access own this)
- VPAT/compliance documentation (niche, low volume, complex)
- Physical ADA compliance (ramps, parking — different market entirely)
- Mobile app accessibility (different tools, different audience — maybe Phase 2)
